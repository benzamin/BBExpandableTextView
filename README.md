```bash
$ gem install cocoapods
```

#### Podfile

```ruby
pod 'BBExpandableTextView', :git => 'https://github.com/benzamin/BBExpandableTextView.git'

#use_frameworks!

target 'YourTargetName' do
pod 'BBExpandableTextView', :git => 'https://github.com/benzamin/BBExpandableTextView.git'
end
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```
